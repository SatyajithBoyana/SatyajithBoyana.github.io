I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, expecting to graduate in the summer of 2024. My dissertation advisor is Prof. Yi Zhang. My research focuses on the development, implementation and analysis of novel discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes constructed using the [DG finite element differential calculus](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2015.10.024), particularly in the context of optimization problems with inequality constraints that arise in many real-world applications such as [inverse problems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2015.07.025), [computational fluid dynamics](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9780898718935.fm), [drug delivery](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2007.06.014), [mathematical finance and economics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-008-9404-4), engineering processes like [cooling processes](https://doi.org/10.1002/oca.984), [flow control and shape optimization in aerodynamics](http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/Papers/jameson.vki03.pdf), etc. However, closed-form solutions are typically not available for such constrained optimization problems. So, it is essential to formulate stable and convergent numerical schemes to construct approximations of the exact solutions. Through this work, I have developed advanced analytical and computational skills, which I believe make me well-suited for interdisciplinary research.

Simultaneously, the doctoral program played a crucial role in shaping my skills as a mathematics instructor. My teaching experiences allowed me to appreciate the complexity of explaining mathematical concepts to students with diverse backgrounds and comprehension levels. These teaching encounters have not only strengthened my pedagogical abilities but also instilled a commitment in me to cultivate a genuine appreciation for learning mathematics. Moreover, my journey as an international graduate student has further ignited my passion for fostering a supportive, adaptive, and inclusive learning environment.
