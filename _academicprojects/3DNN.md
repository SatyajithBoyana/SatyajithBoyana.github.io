The objective of this project is to classify the Iris flower into one of the three classes based on specific characteristics of the flower using neural networks. 

For this purpose, I developed a dense neural network capable of performing the required task. The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris. The design and optimizing of the neural network were implemented using the keras machine learning library, executed on the tensor flow machine learning platform. The optimization algorithm employed to determine the optimal weights and biases is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a default learning rate of 0.01. The project was coded in Python.
