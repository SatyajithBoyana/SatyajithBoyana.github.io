This project aims to comprehend the volumetric sales of avocados in three different sizes (small, medium, large) categorized by PLUs 4046, 4225, 4770, respectively, across major US cities in the year 2020. 

I opted to analyze this dataset because of my personal fondness for avocados, especially as I include avocado toast in my daily breakfast routine. My preference for using the entire avocado for the toast and my reluctance to store cut avocados for the next day lead me to favor small-sized avocados. However, I occasionally encounter challenges in finding small-sized avocados sold under PLU 4046 at my usual grocery store. This curiosity prompted me to delve into the trends of volumetric avocado sales by size in major US cities. The dataset utilized for this analysis was sourced from [www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timmate/avocado-prices-2020). 

Utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), I discovered that in the majority of cities, the sales pattern prominently showcased either small or medium-sized avocados, with a notable absence of both, and some cities exhibited outlier sales in large sized avocados. The project was coded in Python.
