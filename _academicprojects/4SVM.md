The aim of this project is to classify the Iris flower into one of the three classes - Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, Iris Virginica, based on the sepal length and petal length of the flower using support vector machines. 

For this purpose, I created three Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using different kernels and inequality constraints, each fulfilling the required task. The design of the SVM and the optimizing of the SVM were executed using the "SVC" function from sklearn, a machine learning library, and the results from the three configurations were compared and evaluated for accuracy. The project was coded in Python.
