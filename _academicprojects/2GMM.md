After reducing the dimensionality of the data through PCA, the subsequent objective was to cluster the data, as represented by the score plot (i.e., the lower-dimensional data), using Gaussian distributions. 

This was achieved by implementing the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Through the application of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), the data depicted in the score plot was effectively clustered into three distinct clusters. These clusters represent cities with high sales of small-sized avocados, cities with high-medium sized avocado sales, and cities with outlier sales in large-sized avocados. The project was coded in Python.
