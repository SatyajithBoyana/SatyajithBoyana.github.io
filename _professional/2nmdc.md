<h3>Flow ability study of blended coal & functional design of mass flow silos with mild steel as the liner material</h3>
<br>
**Timeline**: May '13 - Jul '13
<br>
**Project Details**:
The goal of this project was to determine the design parameters necessary for ensuring a reliable coal flow from a 500 Ton mass flow coal silo.

Provided relevant parameters including the kinematic angle of wall friction, effective angle of internal friction, critical slope (half hopper) angles, and critical opening size at saturated moisture level (for a blend consisting of 75% moisture) for the circular hopper. These parameters were crucial for the functional design of a 500-ton mass-flow coal silo, ensuring reliable flow. The design was specifically tailored for mild steel as the liner material, utilizing test data obtained across various moisture contents of blended coal, comprising high-ash Indian coal and low-ash Australian coal. The project was carried out at [NMDC](https://www.nmdc.co.in/r-and-d-centre/contact-us).
