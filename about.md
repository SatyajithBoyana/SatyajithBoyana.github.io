  I am an assistant professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics at Florida Polytechnic University. My research focuses on the development, implementation, and analysis of novel discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes, particularly in the context of optimization problems with inequality constraints that arise in many real-world applications such as [inverse problems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2015.07.025), [computational fluid dynamics](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9780898718935.fm), engineering processes like [cooling processes](https://doi.org/10.1002/oca.984), [shape optimization in aerodynamics](http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/Papers/jameson.vki03.pdf), etc. However, closed-form solutions are typically not available for such constrained optimization problems. So, it is essential to formulate stable and convergent numerical schemes to construct approximations of the exact solutions. Through this work, I have developed advanced analytical and computational skills, which I believe make me well-suited for interdisciplinary research.

 My doctoral journey was instrumental in developing my skills as a mathematics instructor. My teaching experiences allowed me to appreciate the complexity of explaining mathematical concepts to students with diverse backgrounds and comprehension levels. These teaching encounters have not only strengthened my pedagogical abilities but also instilled a commitment in me to cultivate a genuine appreciation for learning mathematics. Furthermore, my time as an international graduate student has ignited my passion for fostering a supportive, adaptive, and inclusive learning environment. The testimonials, feedback, and expressions of appreciation regarding my instructional skills from my students can be found [**here**](https://satyajithboyana.github.io/teaching/teaching_UNCG?utm_source=myWebsiteHome&utm_medium=link+click&utm_campaign=home2comments&utm_id=comments#comments_teachinguncg). I view teaching as an ongoing learning journey, constantly seeking ways to enhance my skills and evolve in my career. These comments from students inspire me to persist, encouraging me to explore new perspectives, innovative methods, and pedagogical approaches to enhance their educational experiences. My dedication extends beyond imparting knowledge; I aspire to be a teacher who nurtures the potential of every student who walks through my classroom doors.
