message: "He genuinely cares about the academic success of his students and wants everyone to succeed. Although this may not be the best approach for learning calculus, I believe that American students focus more on memorizing math\r\nformulas than really understanding them, so going into details about each formula isn't helpful sometimes. Therefore, it would be better if Professor SJ\r\nconcentrated more on the idea rather than going into detail to describe how the formulas were created. Overall, he is a very smart professor."
