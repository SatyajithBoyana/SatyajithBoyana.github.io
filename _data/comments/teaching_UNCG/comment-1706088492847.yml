message: "This calculus A class has been the toughest class I have had this semester. I have devoted a lot of time to this class, as expected. I would've\r\nappreciated a study guide before our exams. Overall I recommend taking this course with SJ for anyone needing to take Calc B as well. It is very intensive and we learn the topics at a very fast-paced, emphasis is placed on\r\nunderstanding the concepts not just passing the class, this matches my learning style and once I got used to the pace of the class I started\r\ndoing well."
