message: "The instructor was great. He did a very good job clarifying my doubts. I just not appreciate the structure of MAT-181 class because often times we went over the same examples that I had\r\ndone in my 196 class, I had work to keep up with in both classes and felt overwhelmed, this work cut into the time that I could of used for\r\nstudying concepts/examples that I still struggled with in MAT 196. Personally when I study, I need a space that is quiet, and so I could not\r\nstudy in MAT 181. Overall I felt like I was just doing \"busy work\" in this class and that it was taking time away that I needed to be used for\r\nstudying for MAT 196, I am a college student with other courses too, and I was not aware what I signed up for prior to coming MAT 181\r\nand the whole class structure and assignment overload was a shock to me. I know where and how to use campus resources and I\r\nexpected to have been given the trust and confidence to seek those resources when needed, but instead I was forced to participate in\r\nclass that I did not want to be a part of."
