message: "Hi Professor SJ,\r\n\r\nThis is late on my part but I want to thank you for an excellent fall semester. I truly have learned a lot about myself because of this class, as you pointed out at the beginning of this semester. Thank you for your patience and understanding with all my questions and for taking the time to help me work through and understand the concepts necessary for me to succeed in the course. As challenging as it was, I enjoyed the course, and although I will not continue with calc B this semester, I am very glad I pushed through in the course and came out of the other side a stronger student. I wish you a good time ahead this semester with your studies and any classes you are teaching as well. THANK YOU FOR A GREAT SEMESTER!\r\n\r\nSincerely,
\r\nHolga Ongwacho."
