message: "I took calculus A with Professor SJ. I believe Professor SJ did a good job in explaining the material overall. The only thing is that the class is workload heavy which can kind of interfere with other classes. I felt at times that I had to spend more time on this class in order to complete assignments on time than for my\r\nother classes that also required more time. I do think these homework assignments helped with learning the material, but maybe if they were spaced out a little more that would have been great. Overall, I enjoyed having him as a professor and his way of teaching is on the right track as well."
