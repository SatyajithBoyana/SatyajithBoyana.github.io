message: "seemed to care, at least a decent amount, i knew he didn't get a paycheck bonus if i passed, and was truthful, even when it was\r\neasier not to be, always tried to keep the class engaged too. he is really one of the best instructors ive had, and has understood me.I appreciated the detailed course syllabus, which gave specific dates for lectures and quizzes. It was easy to prepare for things in advance using the syllabus. I liked the professor's passion for the subject material, as it encouraged me to analyze things on a deeper level."
