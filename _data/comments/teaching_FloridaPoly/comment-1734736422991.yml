message: "The teacher made sure that the subject they were teaching was communicated effectively. The teacher also gave good examples for\r\nproblems. They tried to have us actually understand the concepts they taught instead of just trying to have us memorize it. Also, the\r\nhomework for the class was good since, for the most part, the homework given allowed us to see if our answer was wrong and\r\nfigure out why. There were some homework problems with this that put together the other homework's to see if we really\r\nunderstood the concept."
