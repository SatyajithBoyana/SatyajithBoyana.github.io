  I like your teaching style (especially how you explain the *why* behind
  concepts). However, I do feel like a few of the homework problems are way more
  difficult than the examples you give in class and way more difficult than the
  problems on the quizzes. Also, some concepts were not explained in class (for
  example, to find the domain, you first have to figure out when the denominator
  equals zero)
